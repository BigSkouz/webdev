            <h2>What is FNAF?</h2>
            <p>
                Five Nights at Freddy's (Alfredo) is a silly little indie game about a guy attempting to work but getting distracted with robots.
                 There is an elaborate lore. Also, the robots are pretty hungry (they will eat him if they get the chance).

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The silly game was made by Scott the Woz Pilgrim Cawthon in response to the haters who said his other games looked like robots.
                He embraced this and made robots (to eat the haters). He made the first game in a click format with 
                simple tools, allowing him to just casually release like 4 pretty fast (a little too fast).

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                You are stuck in a wheel chair and unable to move your legs. But you are able to telepathically communicate
                with the tools around you to turn on lights, open and close doors, and of course, wire your brain directly
                into the security system to watch the gobbers (animatronics).
