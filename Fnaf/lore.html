            <h2>The origins...</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time, there were two silly guys and they owned a company with a pet bear. One day, this bear died
                and they got a robot to replace it. This was freddy. Then they made more (the rest of them). But, the purple guy was very angry and went
                on a spree and "accidently" made ghost children who haunted the robots. Now they try to eat you (the never got a last supper).

            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>
                According to a certain Mathew Patrick from the Game Theorists on the hit platfrom Youtube, now owned by Google.You play
                 as silly michael. This man is the son of the purple dude who, at them time, was a robot himself. Eventually he found his sister
                (also a robot) and got ""Scooped"". Now he is also purple and trying to hunt his dad down to release the souls from the silly robots
                But turns out, his dad's favorite catch phrase "i always come back" prevents him from this :(
